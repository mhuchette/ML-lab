In this lab we will use Spark ML and Jupyter Notebook to create a model that is capable of classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. 

We will use a data set from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository in order to train and test our breast cancer prediction model. The data set contains measurements of the area, permimeter, concavity, smoothness, and much much of each tumor.

## Objectives:
Upon completing the lab, you will know how to:

1. Connect to cloud object storage and read data used for machine learning.
2. Identify labels and transform data.
3. Conduct feature engineering for algorithm data.
4. Declare a machine learning model.
5. Setup the Pipeline for data transforms and training.
6. Train the data.
7. Show and evaluate machine learning results.
8. Automatically tune machine learning results.
9. Score data and load results into cloud object storage.
